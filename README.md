> ### My Contribution - Frontend Developer (React / Vite)
> I built the React frontend for this project 6 pages: Support Center AI Chat, Payment Lookup, Payment Reversed Check, Report Issue, Customer Verification, Dispute Intake.
> - Implemented `verifyCustomerOwnsTransaction()` and wired all pages to FastAPI backend `GET /api/v1/...` & `POST /api/v1/...`
> - Adapted UI to real backend contract — documented in `frontend/README.md` as "Milkah's UI update"
> - Stack: React + Vite, env `VITE_API_BASE_URL`, CORS handling
> - Original architecture: *AI interprets. Orchestration coordinates. Backend authorizes. Database persists.*

# FinAssist

FinAssist is an AI-powered payment support and resolution agent, built for
the IBM Tech Training.

It is a **payment-support workflow system with an AI interface** — not an
"AI chatbot" that is trusted to act on the world directly.

## Core architectural principle

> **AI interprets. Orchestration coordinates. Backend authorizes. Database persists.**

| Component | Responsibility | Status                                   |
|---|---|------------------------------------------|
| React frontend | Collect and display information |  Implemented                             |
| watsonx.ai | Understand natural language | `MockAIService` stand-in (ADR-003)       |
| Watson Orchestrate | Coordinate workflow/tool calls | `LocalWorkflowAdapter` stand-in (ADR-003) |
| FastAPI backend | Validate, enforce business rules, execute operations |  Implemented                            |
| PostgreSQL | Persist authoritative application state | Implemented                              |

AI output is treated as **untrusted input**. The backend independently
verifies anything the AI extracts (transaction references, amounts, etc.)
before it influences application behavior — see `docs/ai.md`.

## Architecture

We are deliberately building a **modular monolith**, not microservices —
see `docs/decisions/001-modular-monolith.md` for the reasoning.

Read `docs/architecture.md` for the full picture, and `docs/decisions/`
for the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) behind the major calls:

| ADR | Decision |
|---|---|
| 001 | Modular monolith, not microservices |
| 002 | AI interprets, backend authorizes (untrusted-input principle) |
| 003 | Local-first IBM integration (mock AI + local orchestration first) |
| 004 | Reference generation (DB sequences) and duplicate-dispute integrity (partial unique index) |
| 005 | Dispute eligibility matrix (which transaction states can be disputed, and why) |
| 006 | Application services own the database transaction boundary |

## Local prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.12+ (only needed to run the backend outside Docker)
- Node 22+ (only needed to run the frontend)

## Getting started

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set a real POSTGRES_PASSWORD, e.g.: openssl rand -hex 16
docker compose up --build
docker compose exec backend alembic upgrade head
docker compose exec backend python -m scripts.seed_demo_data
```

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# {"status":"ok"}
```

Frontend, in a separate terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
echo "VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000" > .env
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:5173
```

Try it: on the main Support Center screen, enter customer reference
`CUS-10021` and message *"I was charged 800 for TXN-84722 but it failed"*
— this opens a support case and a dispute against the seeded demo data.
The other cards ("Check a payment", "Verify a payment", "Dispute a
payment", ...) route to dedicated pages calling specific endpoints
directly — see `frontend/README.md` for the full page-to-endpoint map.
See `docs/api.md` for the API reference.

## Running tests

```bash
cd backend
pip install .[dev]
DATABASE_URL="sqlite://" pytest --ignore=tests/integration   # 83 tests, no DB needed
ruff check .
python -m scripts.check_secrets ..                            # no hard-coded secrets
```

Integration tests prove behaviour SQLite cannot (DB sequences, the partial
unique index, concurrent dispute creation under real load):

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://finassist:<password>@localhost:5432/finassist \
  REQUIRE_INTEGRATION=1 pytest tests/integration    # 9 tests
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend && npm run build
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs all of the above — lint, secrets scan,
unit/API tests, migrations + integration tests against a real ephemeral
Postgres, and the frontend build — on every push and PR.

## Deployment

Both containers deploy as public-HTTPS services — needed both for
watsonx Orchestrate to call the backend as a tool, and for project
submission. Two equivalent routes are documented, since watsonx
Orchestrate doesn't care which cloud hosts the API it calls:

- **`docs/deployment.md`** — IBM Container Registry + Code Engine
- **`docs/deployment-azure.md`** — Docker Hub + Azure Container Apps
  (avoids IBM Cloud Databases' account-upgrade requirement; Azure's free
  account includes a genuine 12-month free tier for PostgreSQL Flexible
  Server)

Both cover the same real gotchas: the backend-before-frontend build
order (the frontend bakes its API URL in at build time), where
PostgreSQL actually runs (not on the app platform itself, in either
case), and connecting the deployed backend's `/openapi.json` to watsonx
Orchestrate as a custom tool.

## Branch strategy

- `main` always represents a working state.
- One feature branch per logical change: `feature/<short-description>`.
- Pull requests require CI to pass and at least one review before merging.
- No direct commits to `main`.

See `docs/development.md` for full conventions (commit messages, PR
structure, definition of done).

## Current project status

**Core backend implemented and verified end to end**, per the architecture
proposal's milestones 1–8 (see `docs/architecture.md`). Verified against a
real PostgreSQL instance and a real browser driving the real frontend
against the real backend — not just the in-memory test suite.

Implemented:

- Domain models (Customer, Transaction, SupportCase, Dispute) with
  DB-enforced status enums and human-friendly references (`docs/database.md`)
- Full CRUD/lookup API under `/api/v1` (`docs/api.md`)
- Dispute business rules: eligibility matrix (ADR-005), duplicate-dispute
  prevention enforced at both the application and database level (ADR-004),
  verified under concurrent load against real Postgres
- The conversational flow — `POST /api/v1/support/messages` — wiring
  together `MockAIService` (ADR-002 untrusted-input validation) and
  `LocalWorkflowAdapter` (the orchestration boundary) with zero business
  logic in either
- React frontend (6 pages: AI chat, payment lookup, payment-reversed
  check, issue reporting, ownership verification, dispute intake) wired
  to the real API end to end — see `frontend/README.md`'s change log for
  how a later frontend contribution was reconciled with the backend
  contract with zero backend changes
- 92 automated tests (83 unit/API on SQLite, 9 integration on real
  PostgreSQL including a 5-thread concurrency race), all passing
- A consistent error envelope across every endpoint, including request
  validation errors
- Masked personal data on unauthenticated endpoints, and cross-customer
  lookups reported as "not found" rather than leaking ownership
  (`docs/security.md`)
- A dependency-free secret scanner (`scripts/check_secrets.py`) wired into
  both the test suite and CI

**Not yet implemented** (deliberately, per ADR-003 and the "what we are
deliberately not building" list in `docs/architecture.md`):

- Authentication (`docs/security.md`) — `customer_reference` is currently a
  claimed identity, mitigated but not replaced by masking and
  not-found-not-mismatch responses
- Conversation history / multi-turn context (`support_conversations` /
  `support_messages` tables remain deferred, as originally scoped)
